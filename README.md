Solving Algorithms in Kotlin

## Why Kotlin

I'm interested in both the JVM access and the Native Android app possibilities of Kotlin.  
I've also generally been impressed by JetBrains' products, such as Team City and IntelliJ.

## Algorithms Done So Far

1. Grasshopper - Basic Loop Iteration & Summation (_From Codewars_)
2. Bus Stops - Tests use of Pair Data type (_From Codewars_)
